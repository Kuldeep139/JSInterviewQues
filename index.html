// Question 1 :Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
// ans. == : it is used for comparing two variables.
//         We can use == operator in order to compare the two variables even if, they are not of a similar datatype.
// eg:  
console.log(1 == 1);//true

//     === : It is used to compare two variables as well as datatypes.
//          If the variable values are of different types, then the values are considered as unequal.

// eg:  
console.log('1' ===  1);//false

// Question 2: What is the spread operator?
// ans: Spread operator is used to copy an existing array into another array or object.
// It takes in an array or object and expands it into individual elements.

let js = ["function","array","object"];
console.log(...js);


// Question 3: What are the differences between var, let and const?
// ans: let - it is declared in local scope. hoisting is not allowed.
//     const - it is declared in local scope. hoisting is not allowed.
//     var - it is declared in global variable. hoisting is allowed.

// var - *It is a Global scope
//      *It can be reassigned or redeclared.
//      *It can be modified later.
//      *Hoisting is allowed

var a = 2;
console.log(a);
a = 5;

//let - *It is a block scope
//      *It cannot be redeclared or reassigned.
//      *It can be modified later.

let name1; 
name1 ="Kuldeep";
console.log(name1);
name1 = "Rathod"


//const - *It is a block scope.
//      *It cannot be redeclared or reassigned.
//      *It cannot be modified later.

const city = "Mumbai";
console.log(city);

// Question 4: What is execution context?
// ans: When the JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates execution contexts.
//         Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.
//     Execution context is the concept for describing the internal working of a code.
//         It is the execution context that decides which code section has access to the functions, variables, and objects used in the code.

// Question 5: What is meant by first class functions?
// ans: The first class functions are the first-class object which can be stored in variables, passed as an argument in functions and returned from other functions.
//      You can pass functions to other functions as arguments, 
//      return them from other functions as values, and store them in variables.

function sayHi(){
    return  "Heyy!!,";
}
function Name(greet,fname,lname) {
    console.log(greet() + fname + lname)
}
Name(sayHi,"Kuldeep","Rathod")//sayHi fn passed as an argument.

// Question 6: What are closures?
// ans: A closure can be defined as a JavaScript feature in which the inner function has access to 
//      the outer function variable.

function outerFunc() {
    let num = 1;

    function innerFunc(){
        console.log(num)
    }
    innerFunc()
}
outerFunc()
